# ISC-DEV

[![Gitter](https://img.shields.io/badge/chat-on%20telegram-blue.svg)](https://t.me/joinchat/FoZ4MxGETT0_VsVglVl0DA)

Export/Import source code (classes, macro, routines) and DeepSee artifacts (pivots, dashboards, termlists, pivot variables, shared measures) from and to InterSystems Data Platform products (CachÃ©, Ensemble, IRIS). Support versions from 2016.2.

# Installation
Download code and run
```
set dir="/your_download_dir/isc-dev
do $System.OBJ.ImportDir(dir,"*.xml;*.cls;*.mac;*.int;*.inc;*.dfi","cuk",,1)
```
or
import the [release](https://github.com/intersystems-ru/cache-udl/releases) to the namespace.

Map the sc package to the %All namespace to make it visible in any namespace.

# Usage

## Setup working directory ( optional )
```
NS> w ##class(dev.code).workdir("/path/to/your/working/directory/")
```
## Export to working directory:
```
NS> d ##class(dev.code).export()
```
## Import:
```
NS> d ##class(dev.code).import()
```

## Compile, Release and Patch:

Introduce isc.json file in the source root directory with settings for the code mask, for the name of the project and for get the patch form local git or GitHub. e.g.
```
"git": 0 - files diff from local git (default)
"git": 1 - files diff from GitHub
use below params in case of "git" : 1
"owner":  - name of the github e.g. intersystems-community
"repository": - name of the repo e.g. dc-analytics
 "user": - user and password for private github repo
 "password": 
```


```
isc.json
 "compileList": "Classes*.INC,classes*.CLS,*.DFI",
 "projectName": "myproject",
 "git": 0,
 "owner": "owner",
 "repository": "repository",
 "user": "user",
 "password": "password"
```
Run init method to initialize project settings:
```
NS> d ##class(dev.code).init()
```
Then run release() to export all the classes in compileList into one "myproject.xml" release file. It will export it into the default directory for the current Namespace.
```
NS> d ##class(dev.code).release()
```
Or compile it whenever you want to compile all the project related resources.
```
NS> d ##class(dev.code).compile()
```
Get the latest changes from github or local git. Run patch() to export the classes in compileList into one "patch.xml" patch file. It will export it into the default directory for the current Namespace or you can choose the export dir. By default, it makes a patch from the last commit if you do not specify `commitFrom` and `commitTo` e.g.
```
NS> s filename = "c:\patch.xml"
NS> s commitFrom = 1
NS> s commitTo = 5
NS> d ##class(dev.code).patch(filename,commitFrom,commitTo)
```

## Known issues
Be careful with import termlists, pivot variables and shared measures. In the current implementation, imported artifacts replace those you have in the target namespace. It happens because the utility uses standard global import for globals in XML with $System.OBJ.Import which kills the global first and imports the new one.

#### If after using the export command, git treats unaltered files as modified, the problem may be in the following:
- When moving sources from one OS to another (e.g., from win to mac), the end of the line character was not taken into account. To fix this, you need to specify git to make the end of line character look the same.

  solution: ```git config --global core.autocrlf input```
- File access rights have been changed. In this case, you will need to specify that you do not want to track these changes.

  solution: ```git config core.filemode false```

## Development

To update the module in ZPM do the following:
USER> zpm
zpm: USER>load /opt
zpm: USER>repo -n registry -user USER -pass PASSWORD
1) Filesystem
2) Local Cache
3) Remote Repository

Which sort of repository do you wish to configure? 3
zpm: USER>module-action isc-dev publish
